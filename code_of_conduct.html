      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>All members of Women Tech Leaders are required to comply with the following Code of Conduct. The safety of marginalized people will always take precendence over the comfort of priviledged people.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>tl;dr</h2>
      <cite>It's chaos. Be kind. &mdash; Michelle McNamara</cite>
      <p>Women Tech Leaders is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone and safe spaces for people who identify as women or non-binary. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member or participant in any form. This extends to anyone who chooses to become involved in the community through any type of event or interaction.</p>
      <p>Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue, contact the organizers. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Respect</h2>
      <p>Women Tech Leaders is an intentionally positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent members and the diversity of people, cultures, and opinions that they bring to Women Tech Leaders.</p>
      <p>Women Tech Leaders is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, medical conditions, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), socioeconomic status, or physical appearance.</p>
      <p>We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.</p>
      <p>Respectful behavior includes but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.</li>
        <li>Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.</li>
        <li>If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.</li>
        <li>Act like a leader. Lead by example.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disrespectful behavior outside this community may be considered a violation of this code of conduct at the discretion of the Administrators.</p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>This community is not a public space. However, no one has signed a non-disclosure agreement ("NDA") to participate, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.</p>
      <p>If you want to publicly disclose anything discussed here, use the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a> as the guideline (“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed”).</p>
      <p>You must ask the originator of any content you want to reference for permission first. If you don’t receive consent in a reasonable period of time, then assume that no consent has been granted.</p>

      <h2>Resolve Peacefully</h2>
      <p>We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.</p>
      <p>If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.</p>
      <p>If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an organizer. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, distressing in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.</p>

      <h2>Apologize for Mistakes</h2>
      <p>Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.</p>

      <h2>Consequences</h2>
      <p>If you are unable to resolve a situation peacefully, please reach out to an organizer or representative. If they determine that a human is violating any part of this Code of Conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the community, including current and future events without warning or refund.</p>
      <p>As organizers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can't foresee every situation however, and thus if in the organizers' judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.</p>
